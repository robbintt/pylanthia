""" Parse the xml-like token stream coming from DR

User iterwalk to walk the stream

Might want to fix up certain tags before feeding them into this...

If everything is broken, we probably have to write our own walker after all

This is probably best called per xml token that is found


Which means we still need some sort of xml splitter, which is susecptible to breakage.
Any time we get a < we will basically risk triggering the xml splitter.
On failure the xml splitter should display text anyways
But malicious xml in uncontrolled input could cause UI issues


lxml has an Incremental Event Parser but I have major concerns about the XML stuff we have.

SIDENOTE:
    Optimistically: if we consider each line to be its own XML stream provided that
    the line starts with a '<', then we might be able to parse each line individually.

IMPORTANT:
    - I think I need all my windows to be set on... how do i do that: deaths, login, logout, etc.
    - Players will need to turn all these on to get all the streams
    - If one is off the stream should just be empty though, no big deal
