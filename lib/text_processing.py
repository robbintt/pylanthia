    ''' process tcp lines back to front, works in a separate thread

    This function takes raw TCP lines and delivers annotated XML elements and text segments

    What if we use a preprocessor on the queue to create chop_xml_and_text_from_line's results
    THEN we have an XML puller thread that pulls those and processes them into XML events and another Queue
    THEN the `another queue` goes into the text filters and is displayed

    1. XML puller needs to be able to pull both XML and text lines (for multiline html text body)


    The DR output has some XML and some text.
    Sometimes a element stands alone, multiple elements per line. 
    Sometimes a element feeds into the next line.
    Sometimes XML output is multiline.
    Sometimes multiple XML structures are added on the same line.


    Goal:
    We need to be able to split a single line of multiple XML documents up.
    We also need to detect when multiple lines are one XML document.

    processing the xml-style tokens is weird
        ex. inventory streamWindow - primes inventory, but there are still more indicators...
            the final xml before the inv text is: <pushStream id='inv'/>Your worn items are:\r\n
            then after the inv text is: <popStream/>\r\n
    if i could process this multiline token, it would solve some of my issue
    a ton of tokens are duplicate and can just be dropped
